# MapKit Components API Reference
SlimGIS MapKit API Reference is separated to two parts. One is for .NET framework, and another one is for .NET Core framework. Based on those different framework, we built different components above them. See component [API Reference for .NET framework Core here](https://slimgis.github.io/MapKit-API-Docs/DotNetCore/).

### API Reference for .NET framework
MapKit Class Library for .NET is a library that runs with .NET framework. Besides this, we also have class library for .NET Core and Xamarin framework. This document only contains the APIs that are available for running on .NET framework. This class library includes the following MapKit components. 

#### MapKit WebAPI
Built with WebAPI which makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile and desktop applications. It is an ideal platform for building RESTful GIS applications on .NET Framework. It supports developing and deploying on Linux and macOS with Mono. Also supports the same core features (popular data formats, geometries, style, rendering, spatial function and so on).
